So, you want to know more about me - then you're in the right place!

I'm Oscar, as you already know -- a 24 year-old guy born and raised in Trollhättan, Sweden. In most countries, Trollhättan would probably be referred to as what we in Sweden call a "håla", or a smaller town in more formal English. Here, I grew up with my parents and younger brother, and I could probably write a whole book about them and what they mean to me, however that isn't really the goal here (maybe I should add that section later on). More importantly, I've always been interested in science. Ever since I first peeked at the black night sky, fascinated by what's out there, space and astronomy have always been one of my greatest passions. Although, I've always been interested in every science flavour - from maths and physics to ecology, genetics and chemical reactions.

During high school, where I (of course) studied the natural sciences program, I got to dig deeper into the world of science. This was an important part of my life, since it was here I understood that me, maths and physics was a match made in heaven - even though I had a hard time letting go of the chemistry experiments :). However, I just couldn't escape the fact that math and physics was the most fun. This led me to apply to Chalmers in 2020.

Since 2023, I hold a BSc in Engineering Physics, and have after that also pursued one year in Business and Economics at Bachelor level, while working part-time at GKN Aerospace. Since september 2024, I'm studying the Master's program in Physics at Chalmers. After this, my plan is to finish my Economy studies in order to receive a double degree. It would be really cool to work with something that covers both physics and economics, for example Quantum finance, which I find very interesting. Pursuing a PhD is also something I'm considering, if a position in the right field and place appears. This would be a first step towards my childhood dream of becoming an astronaut -- which I still aim towards, although I also have other alternatives. For example, I'm also very interested in consulting, where firms like McKinsey, BCG and Bain always have been my dream workplaces. What inspires me about consulting is the opportunity to work alongside highly motivated (like myself) colleagues, solving organizations' toughest problems. I believe that this career path would improve and develop my professional side significantly, guiding me towards a career at the forefront of technology, where I aim to be in the future.

During spring 2025, I got to experience the adventure of a lifetime when I was nominated to an exchange term at NTU Singapore (one of the best universities in the world). This was definitely a time that I will carry on for a long time, and I still miss it today. I traveled to 10 new countries, met a lot of new people, discoverd plenty of new cultures, while I got to study at a top-ranked university. To inspire and inform future Chalmers students about NTU (and an exchange in general), I wrote a very comprehensive <em>travel report</em>, which you can find [here](https://stommen.github.io/schools/travel_report_chalmers/). In this, I describe essentially everything about my exchange, from the courses I attended and my accommodation at NTU, to my travels during the semester.

When I'm not studying, I enjoy spending time either in the gym or surrounded by friends and family. With my passion for wellness, cooking has also become an interest of mine, and eating – either my dishes or others. The latter almost gives me most joy of all, maybe even more than solving a really tough problem does. The family and I also enjoy playing board games, traveling and skiing. Traveling and skiing is something I really love doing, and probably would do more of if time and my economy allowed. When my friends and I come together, I enjoy grabbing a beer and talk about life, and maybe hit the dance floor at a club.

As a person, I'd describe myself as driven, calm, humble, easygoing and caring. In my friend groups, I go by the nickname "Stommen", which loosely translates to "The Core" or "The Foundation". It doesn't directly describe my personality, but I know my friends and most people around me see me as someone very steady and reliable — like the backbone of the group. However, I also have a "darker" side, where I'm a extremely competitive (bad loser), extremely stubborn (for good and bad), and goal orientated. Most of these maybe aren't "bad" or "dark" traits (even though I've crashed some board games while losing to my family) but they definitely bring out an alternative side of my personality.

In the future, I hope that I can work in the forefront of the world's technological evolution. I believe that the last 10 - 20 years have been very exciting (although I can't remember most of this time-span) and it shows no signs of slowing down, which is very encouraging. Areas that feel extra exciting and fitting for me include fusion energy, quantum computing and exoplanets. One aspect I hope my future employment will cover is being able to not only lead the technological development forward, but also see that it makes the world a better place - for instance by directly supporting its inhabitants or from an environmental perspective.
