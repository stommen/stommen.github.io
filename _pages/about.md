So, you want to know more about me, then you are in the right place!

I am Oscar, as you already know, a 23 year-old guy born and raised in the city of Trollhättan, Sweden. I write city, however, in most countries Trollhättan would probably be referred to as what we in Sweden call a "håla", or a smaller town in more formal english. I have always been interested in science. Ever since I first peeked at the black night sky, fascinated by what's out there, space and astronomy have always been my greatest passion. Although, I have always been into every science flavour - from maths and physics to ecology, genetics and chemical reactions.

During high school, where I (of course) studied the natural sciences program I got to dig deeper into the world of science, which I enjoyed very much. This was an important part of my life, since it was at this point I think I understood that me, maths and physics was the best fit - even though I had a hard time letting go of the chemistry experiments. However, I just couldn't escape that I though math and physics was the most fun. This led me to apply to Chalmers in 2020.

Since 2023, I hold a BSc in Engineering Physics, and have after that also pursued one year in economics at bachelor level, while working part time at GKN Aerospace. After my current MSc, my plan is to continue one year with economics and receive a double degree. It would be really cool to work with something that covers both physics and economics, for example Quantum finance, which I find very interesting. Pursuing a PhD is also something I'm considering, if a position in the right field and subject appears.

When I'm not studying, I enjoy spending my time either in the gym or surrounded by friends and family. With my passion for training, cooking has also become an interest of mine, and eating – either my dishes or others almost gives me most joy of all in life, maybe even more than solving a really tough problem gives. The family and I enjoy playing board games, traveling and skiing. When my friends and I come together, I enjoy grabbing a beer and talk about life, and maybe hit the dance floor at a club. Traveling and skiing is something I really love doing, and probably would do more of if time and my economy allowed.

As a person, I would describe myself as driven, calm, humble, easygoing and caring. In my friend groups, I go by the nickname "Stommen", which loosely translates to "The Core" or "The Foundation". It doesn't directly describe my personality, but I know my friends and most people around me see me as someone very steady and reliable — like the backbone of the group! However, I also have a "darker" side, where I'm a very bad looser, extremely stubborn (for good and bad), very competitive and goal orientated. Most of these maybe aren't "bad" or "dark" traits, even though I have crashed some board games while loosing to my family, but they definitely bring out an alternate side of my personality.

In the future, I hope that I can stand in the front of the world's technological development. I think the last 10 - 20 years has been very exciting (although I can't remember most of this time-span) and it shows no signs of slowing down, which is very encouraging. Areas that feel extra exciting and fitting for me include fusion energy, quantum computing and exoplanets. One aspect I hope my future employment will cover, more than that I thrive doing it, is being able to not only lead the technological development forward, but also see that it actually makes the world a better place - either by directly supporting its inhabitants or from an environmental perspective.
