Hard-working, curious and very competitive MSc student in physics at Chalmers University of Technology with a particularly burning interest in science. Since 2023, I hold a BSc in Engineering Physics, and have after that also pursued one year in economics at bachelor level. When I am not studying, I enjoy spending my time either in the gym or surrounded by friends and family.

Things that especially catches my eyes and ears include:

- Quantum physics :cat:
- (Applied) Quantum computing :atom_symbol:
- Plasma physics :boom:
- Computational physics :computer:
- Astrophysics :star:
- Economy :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- Maths :nerd_face:
- Programming (of course applied in physics) :technologist:
