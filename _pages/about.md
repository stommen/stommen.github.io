Hard-working, curious and very competitive MSc student in physics at Chalmers University of Technology with a particularly burning interest in science.

Things that especially catches my eyes and ears include:

- Quantum physics :cat:
- (Applied) Quantum computing :atom_symbol:
- Plasma physics :boom:
- Computational physics :computer:
- Astrophysics :star:
- Economy :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- Maths :nerd_face:
- Programming (of course applied in physics) :technologist:
- AI/Machine Learning/Deep Learning :robot:

Since 2023, I hold a BSc in Engineering Physics, and have after that also pursued one year in economics at bachelor level, while working part time at GKN Aerospace. After my current MSc, my plan is to continue one year with economics and receive a double degree. It would be really cool to work with something that covers both physics and economics, for example Quantum finance, which I find very interesting. Pursuing a PhD is also something I'm considering, if a position in the right field and subject appears.

When I'm not studying, I enjoy spending my time either in the gym or surrounded by friends and family. With my passion for training, cooking has also become an interest of mine, and eating – either my dishes or others almost gives me most joy of all in life, maybe even more than solving a really tough problem gives. The family and I enjoy playing board games, travelling and skiing. When my friends and I come together, I enjoy grabbing a beer and talk about life, and maybe hit the dance floor at a club. Travelling and skiing is something I really love doing, and probably would do more of if time and my economy allowed.

As a person, I would describe myself as driven, calm, humble, easygoing and caring. In my friend groups, I go by the nickname "Stommen", which loosely translates to "The Core" or "The Foundation". It doesn't directly describe my personality, but I know my friends and most people around me see me as someone very steady and reliable — like the backbone of the group!

However, I also have a "darker" side, where I'm a very bad looser, extremely stubborn (for good and bad), very competative and goal orientated. Most of these maybe aren't "bad" or "dark" traits, even though I have crashed some board games while loosing to my family, but they definitely bring out an alternate side of my personality.

On this web page, you can read more about my education, examining the courses I've taken, my career, projects and maybe peek at my CV.
