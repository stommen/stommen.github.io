So, you want to know more about me - then you're in the right place!

I'm Oscar, as you already know -- a 23 year-old born and raised in Trollhättan, Sweden. In most countries, Trollhättan would probably be referred to as what we in Sweden call a "håla", or a smaller town in more formal English. Here, I grew up with my parents and younger brother, and I could probably write a whole book about them and what they mean to me, however that isn't really the goal here (maybe I should add that section later on). More importantly, I've always been interested in science. Ever since I first peeked at the black night sky, fascinated by what's out there, space and astronomy have always been one of my greatest passions. Although, I've always been into every science flavour - from maths and physics to ecology, genetics and chemical reactions.

During high school, where I (of course) studied the natural sciences program, I got to dig deeper into the world of science. This was an important part of my life, since it was at this point I understood that me, maths and physics was a match made in heaven - even though I had a hard time letting go of the chemistry experiments :). However, I just couldn't escape the fact that math and physics was the most fun. This led me to apply to Chalmers in 2020.

Since 2023, I hold a BSc in Engineering Physics, and have after that also pursued one year in economics at bachelor level, while working part-time at GKN Aerospace. Since september 2024, I'm studying the master's program in Physics at Chalmers. After this, my plan is to continue one year with economics to receive a double degree. It would be really cool to work with something that covers both physics and economics, for example Quantum finance, which I find very interesting. Pursuing a PhD is also something I'm considering, if a position in the right field and place appears.

When I'm not studying, I enjoy spending time either in the gym or surrounded by friends and family. With my passion for wellness, cooking has also become an interest of mine, and eating – either my dishes or others. The latter almost gives me most joy of all, maybe even more than solving a really tough problem does. The family and I also enjoy playing board games, traveling and skiing. Traveling and skiing is something I really love doing, and probably would do more of if time and my economy allowed. When my friends and I come together, I enjoy grabbing a beer and talk about life, and maybe hit the dance floor at a club.

As a person, I would describe myself as driven, calm, humble, easygoing and caring. In my friend groups, I go by the nickname "Stommen", which loosely translates to "The Core" or "The Foundation". It doesn't directly describe my personality, but I know my friends and most people around me see me as someone very steady and reliable — like the backbone of the group. However, I also have a "darker" side, where I'm a very bad loser (and winner), extremely stubborn (for good and bad), very competitive and goal orientated. Most of these maybe aren't "bad" or "dark" traits, even though I have crashed some board games while losing to my family, but they definitely bring out an alternative side of my personality.

In the future, I hope that I can be in the forefront of the world's technological development. I believe that the last 10 - 20 years have been very exciting (although I can't remember most of this time-span) and it shows no signs of slowing down, which is very encouraging. Areas that feel extra exciting and fitting for me include fusion energy, quantum computing and exoplanets. One aspect I hope my future employment will cover is being able to not only lead the technological development forward, but also see that it makes the world a better place - for instance by directly supporting its inhabitants or from an environmental perspective.
