## Tools of engineering physics | 10.5 ECTS

### Aim

The purpose of this introductory course is to equip the students with basic skills in handling some of the common tools employed by physicists and engineers. This comprises both concrete tools relevant for their continued education, e.g. handling the local computer systems and mathematical software, but also experimental methodology and basic principles of physical modeling and analysis. In addition to this, the course serves to orient the students in some of the contemporary research areas where physicist are working today. Communication is an integrated part of the curriculum for the course. The course aims at developing basic genre consciousness along with writing characterized by correctness and feeling for stylistic differences with regard to recipient. In the last part of the course the focus of the communication part shifts to oral presentation in the context of project presentations. The introduction of a sustainability perspective in the analysis of phenomena in physics aims at developing a high sense of sustainability in the future engineers. It is also to be an introduction to the course Environmental Physics. The course also aims to enable students to start developing entrepreneurial skills.
