<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">The following work has, through an analytical and experimental approach, used the 21-cm radio wave emitted by the hydrogen atom to create a map and rotation curve of our galaxy. This has been done by remote control of the SALSA-telescopes located at the Onsala Space Observatory. The intensity of the 21-cm line at different galactic longitudes has been analyzed and this led to the creation of the rotation curve which shows the velocity
\( v(R) )\ of the hydrogen molecular clouds at different distances from our solar system. Using
simple trigonometry, the distance from the clouds to us could be determined and by so
doing, a map of our galaxy was plotted.

Furthermore, the problem "distance ambiguity" has been discussed and its effects on the
measurements carried out by the telescope have been analyzed. The report has come to
the conclusion that it is important to examine the hydrogen clouds at different latitudes
to ensure that the distance to them is correct. This is because the trigonometric formulas
used to calculate the distance sometimes yield two possible solutions. Measuring at different latitudes can provide the information needed to determine the correct value and in so solving the distance ambiguity problem. Finally, the report has been able to establish that our galaxy, The Milky Way, has spiral arms. This is a common feature of spiral
galaxies and shows that The Milky Way is indeed one of these.
