<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; font-weight: bold">Introduction</p>

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">The last decade, the field of quantum information and computing has seen rapid development. Quantum computers have showed the potential to outperform classical computers in certain tasks, and many believe that we are on the edge of a quantum revolution <a href="https://www.iotworldtoday.com/quantum/quantum-computers-shown-to-outperform-classical-computers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a> <a href="https://betterworld.mit.edu/spectrum/issues/2024-spring/the-next-quantum-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>. In December 2024, several publicly traded companies within the quantum computing area reached new records in share prices <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/04/why-quantum-computing-stocks-skyrocketed-in-decemb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a>. So, the interest in quantum computing is growing, also outside of academia, and the field is attracting more and more attention. However, the technology is still in its first phase, and faces many challenges <a href="https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/03/24/quantum-computing-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a>. These include the need for error correction due to noise, upscaling of the number qubits and hardware development. In this report, we will focus on quantum state tomography (QST). This is a method used to characterize the state of a quantum system, which has several important applications within quantum computing, for example in error correction.
