<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; font-weight: bold">Introduction</p>

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">Stating that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seized a firm grip of our world is definitely not an underestimation anymore. Some find this development more intimidating than exciting, and many experts, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have warned governments about this rapid progress <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65746524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. Nevertheless, the fact still stands – that AI now is a part of our daily lives to the highest degree. Nobody missed the outburst of the NVIDIA stock, which as of now has the 3rd largest market cap in the world, or the daily usage of ChatGPT, which has become a habit in many people’s lives <a href="https://betterworld.mit.edu/spectrum/issues/2024-spring/the-next-quantum-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/04/why-quantum-computing-stocks-skyrocketed-in-decemb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a>.

The idea of intelligent life in non-human forms goes back far more than one can imagine. In fact, there are traces of myths and stories about this from ancient times <a href="https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/03/24/quantum-computing-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a>. However, one of the first recorded mentions of AI as we know it today is from the classic "Gulliver’s Travels", written 1726 by Jonathan Swift. He introduces “The Engine”, a machine used by scientists in the fictional stage to generate new information and ideas.

From that point, it would take more than two centuries until Swift’s fictive creation received a name, after Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think” in 1950 [5]. The term Artificial Intelligence was introduced five years later, which later gave birth to the research field <a href="https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/03/24/quantum-computing-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a>. AI later saw substantial development, beginning with early neural networks like the Perceptron (1957) and the introduction of Lisp (1958), which became the dominant AI programming language. After some setbacks in the 70’s and 80’s due to reduced funding, the resurgence of AI came with breakthroughs like backpropagation for neural networks (1986) and increased interest in machine learning. By the late 1990s, AI research had laid the groundwork for modern deep learning and other applications used today. Since then, AI has advanced rapidly, with breakthroughs in deep learning, generative models (like ChatGPT), and autonomous systems.

This project will cover a rather broad spectrum within modern AI, however with the main focus on the technical parts. We will start by providing the backbone of AI – the prerequisites that make it possible, with a special emphasis on semiconductors. After that follows a rather heavy theoretical part on the technology behind AI, starting with an overview of what AI actually is, and later covering the simplest neural networks to more advanced types of AI. In the following chapter, we will move to the practical part, where applications of AI will be discussed, both today and in the past. Finally, we will provide an outlook for the future of AI. However, in order to set the foundation, we will firstly provide a brief introduction to what AI actually is, and how we characterize it as of today.
