Welcome to my travel report from my time at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. I assume that you’re reading this because you consider going on an exchange to Singapore. Or perhaps you’ve already been accepted (to NTU or elsewhere), and are looking for some information about the university, Singapore, Asia, or just what an exchange in Singapore is like in general. In the latter case -- congratulations! You have an amazing time ahead of you. And if you still consider an exchange, go for it! I’d argue that Singapore is a perfect place for this, with the traveling possibilities and highly ranked universities, however I’m sure that you won’t regret it wherever you decide to go. You’ll be able to travel, meet a lot of new people, and experience new cultures.

For an exchange at NTU (or in Singapore in general), I hope that my report can help you – especially regarding preparations. This was probably the most confusing part of the exchange, and it’s covered in the first chapter. Moreover, apart from the preparations, I’ll also discuss the everyday life at NTU (e.g., housing, economy, and spare time activities), the courses I attended, and some traveling tips for both Singapore and Asia. At the end of the report, you’ll also find my exchange budget along with some (hopefully) helpful links and apps for surviving an exchange in Singapore. If you have any questions about the exchange, whether it’s about the preparations, the school and coursework, or traveling in Asia – I’m happy to help! :) You can find my contact information on the title page.

Best Regards,

Oscar
