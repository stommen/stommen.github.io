<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">This study aimed to determine the glass transition temperature of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and to investigate the better-known evaporation, which is important for the soil. The method used to determine the glass transition temperature was differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which involves measuring the heat flux as a function of temperature for a sample of the substance in question and a blank sample as a reference. The result of the measurements gave the transition temperature \( -33.1 \pm 2.1 \ C^\circ \). This differs from previous studies, which may be due to several factors, such as the fact that the transition temperature may vary depending on how quickly the sample is heated or cooled. Evaporation was investigated by comparing how different salt solutions containing sodium sulphate and sodium acetate, and deionized water evaporated over time. Geometric factors, energy input and the number of salt molecules were kept as constant as the equipment allowed. The deionized water evaporated the fastest followed by sodium sulfate, resulting in the conclusion that more energy is required to break the bonds between the salt ions and the water molecules in the sodium acetate solution.
