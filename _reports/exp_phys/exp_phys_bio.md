<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">In this experiment lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were produced by varying methods
and characterized with focus on their size and interaction with artificial lipid bilayers. Nano Tracking Analysis (NTA) revealed that production methods significantly influence LNP size. Using a higher PEG stabilizer concentration resulted in smaller
particles, while the Spark mixing technique produced smaller and more uniform LNPs compared to manual or vortex mixing. Interestingly, a higher pH solvent unexpectedly led to smaller LNPs, contradicting theoretical predictions. However, the mRNA
encapsulation efficiency under these conditions remains unknown and requires further investigation. Moreover, fluorescence microscopy showed that LNPs bound more effectively to lipid bilayers at lower pH, due to stronger electrostatic interactions. In
summary, these findings emphasize the need for additional studies to assess mRNA content within LNPs and explore more lipid compositions to optimize LNPs for specific applications. Future work should continue focus on both nanoparticle formation and their effectiveness as carriers for mRNA delivery.
