<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">In this study, a so-called Michelson interferometer was used to find out the refractive index of air, \( n \), and the wavelength \( \lambda \) of a HeNe laser. The Michelson interferometer uses simple optical components and is mostly used to measure very small distances by studying the interference pattern of a laser shot through the interferometer. The wavelength of the laser could be calculated by studying the number of shifts in the interference pattern as a consequence of changing the optical length (the distance the light travels). The average of all measurements over the wavelength of the laser was \( \lambda = 632.4 \pm 1.52 \ \text{nm} \), which is well within the margin of error from the manufacturer's suggested wavelength of the laser of \( 632.8 \ \text{nm} \). For \( n \), the basic design of the interferometer was modified by adding an air cell with an associated vacuum pump. By reducing the pressure in the air cell and at the same time, again, studying the number of shifts in the interference pattern, the refractive index could be calculated. The resulting refractive index was \( n = 1.000274 \pm \ 7.4 \cdot 10^{-6} \), which after taking into account the special circumstances of this experiment is also well within the margin of error of previously calculated values of \( n \).
