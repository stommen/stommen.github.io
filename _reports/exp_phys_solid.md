<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">With the aim of determining an unknown crystalline element and measuring the optical transmission of gallium arsenide (GaAs), experiments with Debye-Scherrer diffraction and the Cary 5000 and Perkin Elmer 1725 spectrometers have been carried out. In addition, the Hall effect in a doped germanium crystal has been studied. The experiments cover various aspects of solid state physics, an area of materials science of great importance to both industry and research. The unknown element was an FCC structure with lattice parameter \( a = 4.060 \pm 0.072 \ \text{Ã…} \), which was determined to be aluminum. The optical transmission spectrum of GaAs showed a characteristic appearance, including a sharp absorption edge around \( 880 \ \text{nm} \) ( \( 1.4 \ \text{eV} \) ), corresponding to the direct band gap of the material. In the experiment with the Hall effect, values were obtained for two different circuit boards with associated Ge crystals, indicating, among other things, that one crystal is n-doped and the other p-doped. The most significant sources of error could probably be minimized by using alternative equipment for some parts of the experiments.
