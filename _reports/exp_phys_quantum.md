<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">Spectroscopy is central to science, for example to investigate the structure and properties of materials. The aim of this study was to use atomic level spectroscopy to find out the emission spectra of the elements cadmium and neon, and to draw an energy level diagram for cadmium. The spectra for the two elements were obtained by using a spectral lamp/spectral tube with the element and a spectrometer with associated electronic equipment, which were controlled by LabVIEW. The resulting emission spectrum for cadmium was in good agreement with previously performed measurements and the energy level diagram for cadmium showed a clear link to the theory presented and could be constructed by calculating the energy produced by the resulting transitions. The emission spectrum for neon was, as expected, much more complex. This is mainly due to the noble gas structure of neon compared to the few valence electrons of cadmium which, together with emission selection rules, leads to many more allowed transitions. Both spectra had some deviations from previous studies, which are mainly thought to be due to the use of less advanced equipment in this study and possible foreign matter/dirt in the light sources.
