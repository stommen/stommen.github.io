<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">In this report, a three-dimensional brass lattice (Cu\(_{0.5}\)Zn\(_{0.5}\)) was firstly described analytically with a mean-field approach, and secondly, numerical simulations were done using the Metropolis algorithm at varying temperatures. With both methods, the internal energy, \(U\), heat capacity \(C_V\) and long- and short-range order \( P\) and \(r\) were computed. Lastly, the statistical inefficiency for the simulation was calculated with an autocorrelation function and a block averaging method. For reference, the source code for all tasks is available in Appendix C and D and via <a href="https://github.com/stommen/fka122-homeworks/tree/main/H2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.
