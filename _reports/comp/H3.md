<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">In this report, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) was implemented twice -- first in its most basic form and then using importance sampling. In both cases, the Helium atom was studied with the goal to determine the ground state energy. However, as an introduction, a single particle in a Morse potential was studied. Atomic units (a.u.) were used during all simulations, i.e. \( \hbar = e = m_e = 4\pi\epsilon_0 = 1\). Using this unit system, the length unit was the Bohr radius \( a_0 = \SI{0.529}{\angstrom}\) and the energy-ditto the Hartree energy \( E_H = \SI{27.2}{\electronvolt}\).
