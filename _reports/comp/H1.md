<p style="text-align:left; font-size:16px">In this report, we present results from simulations done on 256 interacting aluminum atoms in a lattice represented by a \4\times4\times4\ supercell (i.e. 64 unit cells) using a Neuroevolution potential (NEP) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0106617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>. Apart from simulating the motion of each atom, system properties such as energy, temperature and pressure was calculated. Furthermore, the heat capacity \C_V\, radial distribution function, \g(r)\, and structure factor, \S(q)\, were also calculated. All simulations were done in \texttt{C}, however, plots and some minor calculations were done in \texttt{Python}. For reference, the source code is available in Appendix B and on <a href="https://github.com/stommen/fka122-homeworks/blob/main/H1/analyzer.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.
