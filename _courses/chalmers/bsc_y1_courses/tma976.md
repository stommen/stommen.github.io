## Aim

The course provides basic knowledge of the fundamental theories within mathematical physics.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

- Understand the basic concepts and definitions in mathematical analysis.

- Be able to prove the basic theorems in mathematical analysis in one variable.

- Be able to formulate and solve linear/separable differential equations.

- Be able to expand analytic functions in Taylor series.

- Be able to analyze the asymptotics of certain sequences (for instance coming from linear difference equations and iterations schemes).

- Be able to establish convergence/divergence of series using various tests/criteria.

- Be able to establish convergence/divergence of power series.

- Apply the notions of pointwise and uniform convergence for function series.

- Compute limits of functions in several variables.

- Be able to produce proofs independently.

- Be able to solve problems which involve two or more of the above.
