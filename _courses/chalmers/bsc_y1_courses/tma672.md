## Aim

To present an introduction to linear spaces concepts such as linear dependence/independence, basis, dimension, orthogonality and spectral theory. To give the basics in numerical analysis and computational mathematics.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

- Use linear algebra concepts for solving problems in engineering and science.

- Use mathematical models for numerical solution of real world problems.

- Critically analyze and give advice regarding different methods and algorithms with respect to efficiency and reliability.

**Grade: 4.**
