## Aim

The aim of the course is to provide the basic methodology in analysing analogue electrical and electronic circuits. This includes knowledge on the traditional passive circuit elements, sources, diodes, transistors and operational amplifiers. In addition, the course provides knowledge in how the electrical circuit operates as a system where concepts such as transfer function, frequency response and feedback are treated.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

- Analyze passive linear electrical DC and stationary AC circuits.

- Calculate transient signals in electrical circuits.

- Analyze active electrical circuits based on diodes, transistors and opamps.

- Gain insight into the electrical circuit as a system and be able to analyze time- and frequency response.

- Understand concepts of feedback and stability.

- Understand the design of an oscillator and an active filter.

- Use computer-based tool for analyzing electrical circuits.
