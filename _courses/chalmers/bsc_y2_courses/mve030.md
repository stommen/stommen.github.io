## Aim

The course introduces Fourier methods in the program. These methods are powerful mathematical tools in technology and science.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

After completing the course, the student will be able to solve partial differential equations using separation of variables, eigenfunction and Fourier series expansions, eigenfunction expansions using Sturm-Liouville problems, as well as Fourier and Laplace transforms. In addition, the student will be able to apply the theoretical concepts of Hilbert spaces to solving physical problems. In this regard, the student will be able to determine, based on the geometry of the physical domain and the character of the equation, which orthogonal system, such as trigonometric functions, Bessel functions, or orthogonal polynomials, is best suited to solve the physical problem. The student will also be able to use Fourier series to compute sums, like the sum of 1/n^2. The student will learn how to use Fourier transforms to compute tricky integrals.
