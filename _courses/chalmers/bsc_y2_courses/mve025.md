## Aim

To treat the fundamental theory for complex functions and to demonstrate important areas of application.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

After completion of the course the student should be able to:

- Define basic concepts and prove basic theorems in complex analysis.

- Construct and analyse Möbius transformations and other conformal mappings.

- Find Taylor and Laurent series of holomorphic functions.

- Compute residues.

- Calculate certain real integrals as well as contour integrals using residue calculus,
use the Laplace transform and the z-transform to solve certain equations.

**Grade: 3.**
