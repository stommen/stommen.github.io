## Aim

The aim of the course is to provide the student with a basic knowledge of mathematical methods used in the description and the analysis of physical phenomena in three-dimensional space, in addition to deepen her or his understanding of fundamental classical physics.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

After successfully completing the course the student will be able to analyze problems in physics and engineering science that involve spatial variations of physical observables. Specifically, the student will have acquired basic mathematical tools for differentiation and integration of scalar and vector fields analysis and synthesis of fields, including singularities.

The student will be able to give an account of the field concept in classical physics, and apply it to elementary problems in the theories of classical electrodynamics (Maxwell's equations) and thermodynamics (diffusion equation and the equation for heat transport).

After having completed the course the student may continue with more advanced studies in classical physics.
