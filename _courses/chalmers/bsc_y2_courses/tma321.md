## Aim

Our aim is to give a new view of measurement and information focusing on the variation and uncertainty and on efficient mathematical tools to handle randomness and uncertainty. The usefulness of this approach will be illustrated by physical, technical and other examples.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

After the course, the student should be well acquainted with basic basic probability theory and a good practice of the statistical mind-set, statistical modeling and basic statistical methods.

**Grade: 5.**
