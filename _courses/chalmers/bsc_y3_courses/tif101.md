## Aim

This course is a continuation of the first course in Quantum Physics (FUF040). Here quantum physics is again applied on elementary phenomena, its rôle for the technical physics is further elucidated including modern technological applications. Its realization in a number of different important systems is noticed through exercises and projects.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

- Compute energy levels for systems where approximation methods must be used.

- Solve time-dependent systems.

- Describe the line of thought between the fundamental Schrödinger equation and the rule to build up the periodic system of the elements.

- Describe chemical bonding from quantum mechanical principles.

- Have gained some experience in choosing suitable model and approximation for treatment of specific quantum systems.
