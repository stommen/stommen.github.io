## Aim

The course introduces how one can describe, manipulate, and detect quantum mechanical systems such as single atoms and photons, and how advances in the control and measurement of these systems are driving the so-called second quantum revolution through the four pillars of quantum technologies: quantum computation, quantum simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. This revolution is being pushed forward by large research initiatives worldwide, such as the Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology (WACQT) in Sweden, of which Chalmers is the main node, the EU Quantum Flagship in Europe, and many more. The course gives an overview on this very active field of research and connects via lectures, exercise sessions, and a laboratory session in a state-of-the-art facility to ongoing research on quantum mechanical superconducting circuits, microwave photons, and optomechanical systems.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

- Understand the difference between classical and non-classical radiation.

- Explain the properties of the Jaynes-Cummings model.

- Use the Bloch equations to describe the dissipative dynamics of a quantum mechanical two-level system.

- Compute the output state of simple quantum circuits composed of elementary single-qubit operations, entangling gates and measurements.

- Have a basic knowledge of the leading architectures to build a quantum computer and their comparative advantages and disadvantages.

- Understand the difference between a quantum computer and a quantum simulator, and discuss use cases for both.

- Understand how quantum technology may threaten todayÂ’s encryption keys and how secure communication can be established by quantum links.

- Explain the standard quantum limit and how to break it .

- Explain and experimentally perform manipulations and tomographic measurements of quantum states of a microwave resonator, assisted by a superconducting qubit.
