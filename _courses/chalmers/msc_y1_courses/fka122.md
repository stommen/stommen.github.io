## Aim

The aim of the course is to refine computational skills by providing direct experience in using a computer to solve problems in physics. Numerical techniques are introduced and applied in a broad spectrum of various physical problems. The course is designed to develop an understanding of modeling physical systems using different numerical techniques.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

- Use C to solve numerical problems.

- Explain and numerically apply the basic idea behind the molecular dynamics simulation method.

- Explain how random numbers can be used to treat static and dynamic phenomena and numerically apply the methodology.

- Explain and numerically apply the Metropolis Monte Carlo method.

- Integrate knowledge in modeling physical systems with various numerical techniques.

- Write well-structured technical reports where computational results are presented and explained.

- Communicate results and conclusions in a clear way.
