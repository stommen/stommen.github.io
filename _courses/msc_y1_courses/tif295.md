## Aim

The purpose of this course is to introduce the students to a variety of experimental concepts used in modern physics research, and to give them an opportunity to work on a well defined experimental project of their own choice. The projects span over a wide range of disciplines, from biophysics and materials physics to nanooptics and surface physics, and will be carried out in research groups working in state-of-the-art laboratories at the Department of Physics. The students will work in groups of two or three, and the projects will be presented both in writing and as an oral presentation in a seminar. As a general introduction to the topic, the course will start with several lectures on the physics behind the projects that the students may choose from.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

After this course the students should have a general knowledge of experimental methods in modern physics. The students should be able to write a scientific report based on their own experimental work, and to give an oral presentation describing the used method and the obtained results. After this course the students should also have an increased knowledge and awareness of gender equality, equal treatment and diversity, which will give them the ability to challenge and change unequal structures and cultures.
