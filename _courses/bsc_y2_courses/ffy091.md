## Aim

The Optics course should provide the participants with a basic understanding of classical optics and modern photonics and a foundation for further activities within this area, an important part of which is the simulation of optical phenomena and devices with software developed by the participants themselves.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

Having completed the course, the participant should be aware of some strengths and shortcomings of the wave and particle models for light, respectively, and be able to explain and analyse with analytical and numerical methods:

- Lenses, spherical mirrors and oher thin optical components.

- Diffractive components.

- Polarization changing components.

- Imaging systems working with incoherent light.

- Systems measuring or being influenced by the coherence of light.

- Optical waveguides, in particular the optical fiber and possess basic knowledge about light sources, including the laser.

**Grade: 4.**
