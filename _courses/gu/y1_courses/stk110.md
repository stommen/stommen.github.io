## Learning outcomes

On successful completion of the course the student will be able to:

- Calculate the probability of different events.

- Draw correct conclusions about populations based on random samples.

- Understand and handle both discrete and continuous distributions.

- Analyze large datasets using a computer programme.

- Critically review statistical material and report (in writing) relevant aspects of it.

## Course content

In this course, the student will be introduced to basic statistics. The course covers a
review of methods for compiling, presenting and calculating summary measures used to
describe statistical data. This includes, among other things, measures of central tendency
(mean, median, etc.) and measures of variability (standard deviation, variance, etc.).

To be able to interpret the statistical results, a basic understanding of probability is
crucial. Therefore, the course also covers basic probability theory, as well as how
probability for different events are affected by a variable's distribution. Finally, the
basics in how information from sampling can be used to draw conclusions about
populations are discussed. This is done by hypothesis testing, point estimation or
interval estimation for a population.

When analyzing statistical data, the computer is an indispensable tool. The course
therefore includes computer-based project work, which consists of a number of
assignments, where the student gets both an exercise in and assessment of work with
computer-based statistical analysis.
