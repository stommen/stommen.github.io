## Course content

The focus in management accounting is on achieving stated financial and non-financial
goals. Its core aim is to steer the firm and management in a direction that will result in
goal fulfillment. In order to steer the firm towards the goals, various accounting
instruments are needed. The course focuses on formal management instruments, i.e.
fundamental concepts, models and relationships that can be used in the financial control
of a firm. The course covers a number of formal instruments of traditional character,
including budgeting, product costing and financial performance measurement.

The purpose of the management instruments is to use them in a way that makes the firm
management act effectively, efficiently and in line with the firm’s strategies, in order to
achieve financial and non-financial goals. The formal instruments are useful when
calculating prices, costs and results for goods and services, when ensuring sufficient
liquidity and net income, when measuring the profitability of different organizational
units, products and/or services, when managing staff behavior and when reporting the
outcome of business operations. A new task for the formal instruments used in
management accounting, and for the individuals who work with them, is to merge social
and environmental aspects.
