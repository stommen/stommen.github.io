## Aim

The course provides basic knowledge of mathematical analysis, which is necessary for most courses to follow at the Engineering Physics programme.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

- Understand the fundamental notions and definitions of mathematical analysis.

- Prove the most fundamental theorems within analysis of functions in one real variable.

- Use mathematical induction to prove identities and inequalities.

- Rewrite expressions which contain logarithms and the inverse of the trigonometric functions.

- Use a combination of standard limits in order to find other limits.

- Analyze functions in order to draw their graphs.

- Use standard methods to find the antiderivatives of some elementary functions.

- Use the main theorem of analysis to compute Riemann integrals.

- Apply Riemann integration on length, area and volume computation.

- Use comparison methods to determine convergence/divergence of improper integrals.

- Give proves of his/her own.

- Solve problems combining two or more of the above abilities.
