## Aim

C is important for system programming and developing embedded systems. It combines the benefits of both low machine level languages and high-level developer friendly languages and is very fast. C++ is widely used in producing gaming engines, virtual reality applications, web browsers, building popular database tools, blockchain technology. This course lays the foundation knowledge in C and C++ programming.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

- Design and implement simple C programs using basic programming constructs.

- Design and implement pointers, arrays, character strings and structures in C.

- Design and implement recursive functions in C.

- Design and implement linked lists in C.

- Develop object-oriented programs in C++ using classes, inheritance and polymorphism.

- Master the usage of common containers of Standard Template Library in C++.

**Grade: C+.**
