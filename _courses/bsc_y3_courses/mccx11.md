## Aim

In the bachelor thesis project, the student will integrate, extend and develop knowledge and skills within a smaller, specialized part of the field of the programme. The bachelor thesis also aims to develop skills in application of engineering problem solving and research methods.

## Learning outcomes (after completion of the course the student should be able to)

### Knowledge, understanding, competence and skills

- Formulate and delimit a problem within the chosen subject.

- Plan a project in order to solve and report the problem with given resources.

- Search for, compile and assess relevant literature and other background information.

- Integrate and develop knowledge relevant for the chosen project.

- Reflect on how the project group worked together to meet common goals.

- Document the work process in a project journal.

- Communicate the results of the bachelor thesis work in relation to the chosen problem in written and oral form.

### Judgement and approach

- Critically examine, evaluate and constructively question another project with respect to problem, approach and results.

- Assess if societal and ethical issues need to be considered for the chosen problem and, where relevant, analyze these aspects in the essay/report.

- Reflect on the need for further knowledge and provide suggestions for future projects in the subject.
