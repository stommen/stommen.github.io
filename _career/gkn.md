**June 2023 – Aug 2023**
I spent the summer of 2023 working as an intern at the Digital Engineering and Simulation department within the Global Technology Center (GTC) at GKN Aerospace. GKN is a leading global tier one supplier of airframe and engine structures, landing gear, electrical interconnection systems, transparencies, and aftermarket services. They also have production towards the space industry. Read more about GKN [here](https://www.gknaerospace.com/about-us/).

During the summer I mainly worked on two projects:

- One Python program to simplify data collection and analysis for a specific project. In short, the code read .csv-files containing data from specific sensors, plotted the values and sent the produced figures to a PowerPoint presentation.

- Another Python program to simplify stress calculations by executing these through Python instead of the regular calculator program, which is a lot slower. The program also related each unit load case contribution to the total stress at a certain node, making analyzation of the total load easier.

As a side task, I mapped the patent portfolio of MTU (one of GKN's greatest competitors) together with the Intellectual Property team.
