**Sep 2023 – June 2024**
During the gap year I chose to have between my engineering BSc and MSc, I had the opportunity to extend my internship at GKN as a part-time intern, while also taking full-time economy courses at Gothenburg University. GKN is a leading global tier one supplier of airframe and engine structures, landing gear, electrical interconnection systems, transparencies, and aftermarket services. They also have production towards the space industry. Read more about GKN [here](https://www.gknaerospace.com/about-us/). I worked on two major projects that significantly enhanced my technical and collaborative skills:

- ***Matlab Data Collection Project:*** I developed and expanded a Matlab script for data collection in preparation for an upcoming engine test. Entering this project, I was already comfortable with Matlab, and while it didn't develop my Matlab coding skills much further, it reinforced my confidence in my ability to tackle any challenge using this language.

- ***Python Quality Assurance Project:*** I developed a Python package for creating a Quality Assurance document for Python projects used internally at GKN. This project improved my Python coding skills significantly, and broadened my language knowledge to include HTML and YAML. Additionally, it strengthened my collaborative coding abilities through the use of Microsoft Azure and Git.

Both tasks also gave me a great opportunity to peek into the life and work of an engineer, with weekly meetings, follow-ups, teamwork, and problem-solving, which I value a lot from an experience perspective.
