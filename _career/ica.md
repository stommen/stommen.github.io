At ICA by my summer cottage, I was mainly responsible for the cash-registers, but I also spent time in the charcuterie and also unpacking goods. In my final year, I also felt more responsibility as a mentor to the new starters, although this was not stated by my employer.

I value the summers I spent at ICA very high as this felt more like serious work. Above all, I take with me all the meetings with people and the ability to work in pressured situations, which I think has been very important for me.
