**July 2019 – Aug 2019**
I had my first job in the X-ray department at the hospital in my hometown Trollhättan. Here I mostly had simple responsibilities in the kitchen (cleaning and dishes) as well as other simple tasks such as unpacking equipment. I also got to spend time with the employees and got an insight in their work. This was a good first job as it gave me a new type of discipline as well as an insight into what it can look like in a workplace.
